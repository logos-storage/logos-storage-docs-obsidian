This is our documentation repository. All documents that need to be recorded and available to the whole team have to end up here. This repository is also an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. As much as you can jump directly to a specific Markdown file, it is strongly advised that you use Obsidian to update existing docs and to create and link new ones. Otherwise you may break the linking and cause problems to other users of this repo.

### Quick start

First, clone this repo to a local directory on your computer (e.g. `~/Documents/obsidian/codex):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:logos-storage/logos-storage-docs-obsidian.git
```

Then install [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/download) (use the best method suitable for you OS).

Finally, open the cloned folder (a vault) in Obsidian.

Now you have a searchable Codex documentation vault under your full control. Everything you do in Obsidian remains private as long as you do not commit and push your changes to GitHub. Our `.gitignore` keeps some of the vault file ignored, meaning they will stay only visible to your Obsidian installation. For instance, the publishing settings and the workspace configuration (kept in the `.obsidian` folder) are excluded from GitHub syncing, as those are personal and change every time you open the vault. You can read more about what is ignored in [[Ignored Obsidian Vault files]].

> To get some background about Obsidian and *Knowledge Management Systems*, please check [[Short Introduction to Obsidian]]. We also have some video tutorials: see [[Using Codex Obsidian Vault Video Tutorials]].

Now, when you have everything up and running, learn a bit more about our documentation setup and how to take full advantage of it. See [[Codex Documentation Setup]] in - of course - Obsidian.
