My ideal world scenario is that I can use Codex like I have been using it, to exchange chunked datasets. What I have been missing the most:

1. Light clients (mobile, browser);
2. Being able to publish a dataset without a public IP;
3. Pin to a node;
4. Force remove;
5. Range headers would be cool for Podex.
