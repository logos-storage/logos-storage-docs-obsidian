This is the simplest workflow. Ideal if you do not need to collaborate with many other contributors on the document or when using the GitHub PR comments is sufficient.

1. Create the document in Obsidian.
2. Create a branch and a (draft) PR.
3. Get the approval(s).
4. Merge to `main`.

That's it from the team collaboration perspective.
